About the Project
-----------------

*justCheckers* is an advanced, cross-platform  open source checkers game. The aim of 
the project is to make a game capable of supporting:

- Skinning
- Network Games
- Computer Opponents
- Various Rules and Internationalizations
- Cross platform (both OS and input types)

Current Progress
----------------

The *justCheckers* project is in the middle of a general overhaul of the codebase to allow for a more modern approach.  Both the game engine needs to get decoupled from the platform specific code.
